# UFOs


## Overview of Project
  - The goal of this project  was to build an interactive web app and table that allows its users to analyze multiple different UFO sightings that were recorded across America during the month of January in 2010. At first we initialized the web app to be able to filter the UFO sigting data only using the date that the sighting occured. By inputing a date, the table we created on the web app would parse through the data set and return any UFO sightings that were recorded on that date, along with some of the characteristics of that sighting and a breif description. Then to make the web app more interactive and precise we updated the table to allow the user to search by additinal criteria like the location of the sighting ( city, state, county )and the shape of the sighting.

## Results
  - By utilizing Java script and HTML code we were able to create an interactive table that allows it's users to input search criteria such as a UFO sighting's Location by state, City, Country, and the Shape of the sighting. We created an input box, located on the left hand side of the web app. Before inputting any search criteria, the full data set is shown in tabular form next to the search box.![Uploading image.png…](https://github.com/Jess-Vannatter/UFOs/blob/main/App_Images/no_search.png?raw=true)
  
  - By in putting your preferred search criteria, for example we could search for all UFO sigtings that occured in Florida (fl) during this time frame. Which would return a table listing out all UFO sigtings in Florida.![Uploading image.png…](https://github.com/Jess-Vannatter/UFOs/blob/main/App_Images/fl_search.png?raw=true)
  
  - In addition, we created an even more accurate and interactive experience for the user by allowing them to search by multiple criteria. The user could add an additional search criteria (on top of just searching for UFO sightings in Florida). For example they could search for UFO sightings in a specific City located in Florida, like Jasper.![Uploading image.png…](https://github.com/Jess-Vannatter/UFOs/blob/main/App_Images/fl_jasper_search.png?raw=true)

## Summary
  - **Drawbacks**:
      1. The data set used for this analysis is rather small and does not include other countries. One of our search criteria options for the new design is "Country". Which would let the user of the web app assume there would be more than one country option in the data set. But there is not. You may be able to draw more conclusions from this data if you were able to see other countries descriptions and information.

  - **Recommendations**:
      1. Other than recommending that the data set be larger and encompass additional countries, I would suggest adding additinal seach criteria options for "shape", "Duration", and even possible "Key words" in the description. For example, the user would be able to input words like "Hovering" or "Bright Lights" in the search box and the table would return all sightings that have descriptions containing those words. 
      2. Additionally, I would suggest widening the time frame of the data set used. The data set only covers a couple of days worth of data. Ideally, the data should cover years worth of information. Then with a much larger data set, the additional search criteria listed above could be even more usefull. I think by adding the additinal search criteria and possibly a larger data set that covers multiple countries and spans over multiple years of sightings, then we would be able to provide a very informative and interactive experience for the user of the web app.
